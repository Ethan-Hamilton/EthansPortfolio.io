# README for My Portfolio Website

## Hosting
My portfolio website is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a reliable and easily accessible platform. The hosting process involves pushing my HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap files to a GitHub repository, then enabling GitHub Pages to serve my portfolio as a website.

## Innovation
I have integrated a variety of animation functions to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of my portfolio. These include section titles that slide in as you navigate through the page and a coin-flip animation for my photo. These elements create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Web Technologies
The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment, leveraging its powerful features and extensions to streamline the coding process. Aesthetic color schemes, including black, white, and blue, as well as gradients, are used to create a visually appealing design.

## Compatibility
The design and structure of my portfolio are tested for compatibility across various web browsers and devices. I utilized Bootstrap to ensure a consistent and accessible experience for all users, making the portfolio viewable on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The mobile version includes a navigation bar with a drop-down icon for easier access.

## Specifications
I adhered to the following specifications in developing my portfolio website:
- **Dynamic Portfolio:** The website serves as a virtual CV, showcasing my professional profile.
- **Sections Included:** The website includes sections such as About Me, Resume/CV, Projects (with descriptions and links to GitHub repositories), Skills, Contact Information, and any additional relevant sections.
- **Aesthetics and Usability:** The website is designed to be aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and a demonstration of technical proficiency and creativity.

## Navigation
I have included a navigation bar with links to the following sections:

This navigation bar allows users to easily move between sections, providing a seamless browsing experience.
